The result was the flooding of residential areas with bungalows disappearing in the swollen banks of the river. Those who had gone to sleep before the river burst its banks simply died in their sleep as they were submerged. Worst hit were women and children.\n\nThe casualty figure in Benue State was put at 23 dead and 76 injured while over 100 communities were adversely affected which they said would have a telling effect on the agrarian state referred to as the food basket of the nation. Farmlands were not spared where over 50 per cent of the population engage in agriculture. Their means of livelihood were simply wiped out. In the Makurdi metropolis, rising water level got as high as roofs, forcing residents to flee. Nigeria Air Force Base, Kilometre Five, Gyado Villa, Wurukum, Kucha Utebe, Wadata and timber market were worst hit among others.",
